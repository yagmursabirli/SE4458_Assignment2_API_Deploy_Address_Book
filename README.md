‚öôÔ∏è Common Issues & Fixes
1. Swagger file not found on Vercel (ENOENT)

Fix: Used path.join(__dirname, 'swagger.yaml') to ensure correct path resolution.

2. Swagger UI static file routing error

Fix: Added a vercel.json file with rewrite rules to route all requests through index.js, ensuring static files load correctly.

3. CORS errors

Fix: Configured Express with CORS middleware to allow external requests.
